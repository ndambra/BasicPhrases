# BasicPhrases
A simple app that audibly translates simple English phrases to Spanish


A very basic app to learn a small set of basic phrases in Spanish. There are 8 preset phrases that when pressed will play audio of the phrase in Spanish. 

The app is currently only available for Android devices. The files can be download and opened in Android Studio.

This app shows off my ability to use grid layouts, buttons, and play audio based on users click.
